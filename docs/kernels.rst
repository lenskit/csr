Kernels
=======

.. py:module:: csr.kernels

More sophisticated CSR operations, such as multiplications, are provided by a *kernel*.
Numba supports multiple kernels; at import time, a default kernel is loaded and is
available as `csr.kernel`.  Numba-compiled functions using the CSR kernel should
access it through this module.

There are currently three kernels available:

numba
    This kernel implements the operations directly with Numba-compiled functions.

mkl
    This kernel uses the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) to implement the operations.

scipy
    This kernel is not intended for general use, and only exists to make testing and
    benchmarking easier.  It uses SciPy's sparse matrices to implement matrix math,
    and **cannot be used from Numba**.

The default kernel is automatically selected when ``csr`` is imported.  It is selected
as follows:

1.  If the environment variable ``CSR_KERNEL`` is set, its value is used as the kernel
    name.
2.  If the MKL kernel is compiled and MKL is available, it is used.
3.  Otherwise, the Numba kernel is used.

The PyPI packages do **not** include the MKL kernel.  CSR only supports MKL when used
with Conda; the conda-forge packages for Intel platforms include the MKL kernel.

More kernels may be added in the future; for example, it may be useful to add a CUDA kernel,
or if an optimized sparse matrix package for 64-bit ARM becomes available.

Dynamic Kernel Selection
------------------------

The kernel used by the Python APIs can be changed at runtime as well.  This does **not**
change the kernel exposed as ``csr.kernel``, which is used by Numba-compiled client
functions.

.. autofunction:: get_kernel
.. autofunction:: set_kernel
.. autofunction:: use_kernel

Kernel Interface
----------------

.. py:module:: csr.kernel

The :py:mod:`csr.kernel` module exposes the kernel interface.  These same functions are
available on any kernel, including those returned by :py:func:`csr.kernels.get_kernel`.

Handles
~~~~~~~

The kernel interface is built on opaque *handles*: a :py:class:`csr._CSR` needs to be
converted to a handle with :py:func:`to_handle`, and subsequent operations use that
handle to access the matrix.  Handles must be *explicitly* released, or they will
generally leak memory.

Kernels must be created from the underlying native representation â€” you cannot directly pass
an instance of :py:class:`csr.CSR`.

.. autofunction:: to_handle
.. autofunction:: from_handle
.. autofunction:: release_handle

Manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofunction:: order_columns

Multiplication

.. autofunction:: mult_vec
.. autofunction:: mult_ab
.. autofunction:: mult_abt
